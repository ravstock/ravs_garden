#  Updating 2FA

One of the first and most painful things to do when extracting yourself from the big tech is to transfer all your 2FA passwords. 

Especially if you're using Google Authenticator because, unsurprisingly, you can't bulk export your codes. 

It's doubly bad if you ever did anything in the crypto space because you've got 2FA codes coming out the wazoo. 

I'm chunking it down to 4-5 codes per night and I should be done in a couple of weeks! Faaaark. 

On the plus side, it's a decent chance to see what I can get rid of and where, I can improve security. 

For reference, I'm killing 1Password, as I'm done with their subscription models. And using a free service called KeepPass, which is cross-platform (via iPhone app). 

I'll have to manually update both platforms for now. But will soon set up my own private local stand-alone option. I think using Syncthing, but haven't tested it yet. 

So yeah, total ball breaker. But let's face it, it's only going to get worse and more complicated with more passwords as we move forward. 

Eventually, I'll want a Yubikey or similar, but first, Iâ€™ve gotta extract myself and my passwords from third-party control.
